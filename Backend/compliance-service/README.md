## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.0
- Spring Security + JWT (jjwt 0.11.5)
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL 8.x
- Maven
- REST APIs (Postman testable)

---

## Prerequisites
1. Java 17+
2. Maven 3.8+
3. MySQL 8.x running on localhost:3306
   - Username: root | Password: root (change in application.properties if different)

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Databases
```sql
-- Run this in MySQL Workbench or CLI:
source database-schema.sql
```
Or let Spring Boot auto-create them (ddl-auto=update is set).

### Step 2: Start All Services (run each in separate terminal)
```bash
cd identity-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd student-service  && mvn spring-boot:run
cd course-service   && mvn spring-boot:run
cd exam-service     && mvn spring-boot:run
cd attendance-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd compliance-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd notification-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 3: Test with Postman
Import `POSTMAN_COLLECTION.json` into Postman.

|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Operator               | operator@edulink.com       | Operator@123  |

| Student                | student@greenwood.edu      | Student@123   |

---

## How to Test with Postman (Step-by-step)

1. **Login** → POST `http://localhost:8081/auth/login`  
   → Copy `accessToken` from response

2. **Set Token** in Postman:  
   Add header: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`

3. **Call role-specific APIs** using the appropriate token.

## JWT Token Flow
1. Login → Receive `accessToken` + `refreshToken`
2. Include `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on every request
3. Token contains: email, role, userId
4. Each microservice validates JWT independently (stateless)
5. `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_NAME')")` controls endpoint access

## Temporary Password Flow (Teacher/Student)
1. Admin creates account → system generates temp password
2. Response includes `temporaryPassword`
3. User logs in with temp password
4. `mustChangePassword: true` in login response
5. User calls `/auth/change-password` to set new password
6. User can now access all features
