## Database Schema Overview
- **users**: User accounts (id, email, fullName, role, password, etc.)
- **students/teachers/compliance_officers/regulators/board_officers**: Role-specific tables (userId/email, additional fields)
- **courses**: Course definitions (id, courseCode, courseName, subject, grade, teacherId)
- **classrooms**: Class instances (id, className, grade, section, teacherEmail, courseId)
- **learning_materials**: Uploaded materials (id, courseId, teacherEmail, title, fileUrl, materialType)
- **assignments**: Assignments (id, courseId, teacherEmail, title, dueDate, maxMarks, questionsFileId)
- **exams/grades/submissions**: In exam-service
- **attendance_records**: In attendance-service
- **audit_records**: In compliance-service
- **notifications**: In notification-service

Relations: classrooms → courses, learning_materials → courses, assignments → courses.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.0
- Spring Security + JWT (jjwt 0.11.5)
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL 8.x
- Maven
- REST APIs (Postman testable)

---

## Prerequisites
1. Java 17+
2. Maven 3.8+
3. MySQL 8.x running on localhost:3306
   - Username: root | Password: root (change in application.properties if different)

---

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Databases
```sql
-- Run this in MySQL Workbench or CLI:
source database-schema.sql
```
Or let Spring Boot auto-create them (ddl-auto=update is set).

### Step 2: Start All Services (run each in separate terminal)
```bash
cd eureka-server && mvn spring-boot:run
cd config-server && mvn spring-boot:run
cd identity-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd student-service  && mvn spring-boot:run
cd course-service   && mvn spring-boot:run
cd exam-service     && mvn spring-boot:run
cd attendance-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd compliance-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd notification-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd api-gateway && mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 3: Test with Postman
Import `POSTMAN_COLLECTION.json` into Postman.

### API Gateway
Use the API Gateway at `http://localhost:8080` to access backend services through discovery and circuit breaker routing.
Example routes:
 - `/student/**` → `student-service`
 - `/course/**` → `course-service`
 - `/auth/**` → `identity-service`

---

## How to Test with Postman (Step-by-step)

1. **Login** → POST `http://localhost:6060/auth/login`  
   → Copy `accessToken` from response

2. **Set Token** in Postman:  
   Add header: `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`

3. **Call role-specific APIs** using the appropriate token.

| POST   | /teacher/grade-student    | TEACHER |
| GET    | /student/grades           | STUDENT |

### Attendance Service (Port 8085)
Attendance service follows the same layered architecture as the other microservices, with `AttendanceController` delegating business logic to `AttendanceService` and persistence to `AttendanceRepository`.
| Method | Endpoint                  | Role         |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|
| POST   | /teacher/mark-attendance  | TEACHER      |

| GET    | /admin/attendance-report  | SCHOOL_ADMIN |

### Compliance Service (Port 8086)
| Method | Endpoint                        | Role                        |
|--------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| POST   | /compliance/audit-school        | COMPLIANCE_OFFICER          |
| GET    | /compliance/compliance-status   | COMPLIANCE_OFFICER/REGULATOR|

| GET    | /regulator/system-audit         | REGULATOR                   |

### Notification Service (Port 8087)
Notification service follows the standard Spring Boot layered structure: `controller`, `service`, and `repository` packages. The `NotificationController` delegates business logic to `NotificationService` and persistence to `NotificationRepository`.
Notifications can now be scheduled for automatic delivery with `scheduledAt`, and `NotificationService` runs a scheduler to trigger them when their time arrives.
| Method | Endpoint                  | Role    |
|--------|---------------------------|---------|
| POST   | /notifications/send       | Any     |
| POST   | /notifications/schedule   | Any     |
| GET    | /notifications/my         | Any     |
| PUT    | /notifications/{id}/read  | Any     |

## JWT Token Flow
1. Login → Receive `accessToken` + `refreshToken`
2. Include `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` on every request
3. Token contains: email, role, userId
4. Each microservice validates JWT independently (stateless)
5. `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_NAME')")` controls endpoint access

## Temporary Password Flow (Teacher/Student)
1. Admin creates account → system generates temp password
2. Response includes `temporaryPassword`
3. User logs in with temp password
4. `mustChangePassword: true` in login response
5. User calls `/auth/change-password` to set new password
6. User can now access all features
